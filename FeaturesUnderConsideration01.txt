✅ 1. Clear All Filters button
[Done] ✔️ You added a button that clears all selected filters.

You also made it greyed out until filters are active.

🔜 2. Sync sorting or pagination into the URL
This helps users:

Share links with current sort/page

Navigate with back/forward browser buttons

Keep state when refreshing

🛠 You’ll need to:

Add pagination state (like page=2)

Add sort state (like sort=popularity)

Reflect those in the URL and stores

Update them on change

🔜 3. Sidebar collapses on small screens and remembers state
This improves usability on mobile/tablets:

Sidebar auto-collapses on smaller viewports (e.g. < 768px)

Remembers open/closed state across reloads or navigation

🛠 You’ll likely:

Use window.innerWidth to detect small screen

Use localStorage or a writable store to persist sidebar state

Restore on mount

Which one would you like to tackle next?
☑️ Sort/pagination
☑️ Collapsible sidebar with memory

Your call!
